# OldUnreal Game Installers for macOS

These are our installers for macOS. Due to various technical and legal
restrictions, we cannot install the full game with these installers. Instead,
these installers download the original game iso, extract it, and set up your
game assets folder in ~/Library/Application Support/.

After running this installer, you should download and install the game's
Application Bundle from the patches repository. You can get these bundles here:

For Unreal Gold:
